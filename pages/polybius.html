    <h1>The Polybius Cypher</h1>
    <p class="info">
        The Polybius Cipher was invented by the ancient Greeks, and is a relatively simple cipher.
        It uses a table to arrange the alphabet into five rows and columns, and each number in the
        encoded message relates to a character on the grid. For example, the character at square 1-1
        would be encoded as '11'. Because the greek alphabet only had 24 characters, they omitted the
        square at 5-5. However in the English language there are 26 characters, so I and J are often
        combined at square 2-4. It's kind of funny that because we don't use 24 characters like the
        creators did that we use 24 to represent two different characters, don't you think?
